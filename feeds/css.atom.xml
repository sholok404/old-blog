in the sense that it did too much for me. The problem I mainly faced with was
colouring; Bootstrap's navbars and other components already had a fixed color
and modifying something so advanced was pretty complicated. So, I decided watching
some Dragon Ball Z would be some great stress relief. I soon got bored rewatching
the same shit and so I decided to go back to coding and this is when I got the idea;
I could make my own framework! Because I was still in the mood of DBZ, I named
my framework Kaioken CSS in the sense that it would basically power up CSS functionalities
and could be used by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, Kaioken CSS is a no-nonsense CSS framework. It comes with a flexbox grid
system and some UI components like navbars and footers; however it is in no way a
UI framework. It only includes the layout for some common components so that the developers
can make their website however they see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've published it under the MIT license and put it up on Github. I've also documented
it and put up some contribution guidelines. You'd probably want to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
