stuff. Basically, this is me complaining about my parents thinking web development
is easy stuff. If you didn't already know, I have been programming since I was
7 so I am pretty good at this stuff. I built my first website when I was about
7 and a half so I got some spotlight among family members but recently my cousin, who is 13,
managed to do the same thing however, he didn't really code anything. He used
one of those web site builders; you know like &lt;a href="http://www.simplesite.com/"&gt;SimpleSite&lt;/a&gt;.
Although I appreciate his efforts, my problem was that my parents thought that
MAKING &lt;a href="https://sholok404.github.io/digital-agency-theme/"&gt;THIS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/sholok404/srl-marine-products/"&gt;THIS&lt;/a&gt;
IS SIMPLE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all I have to say. If a close relative of a programmer is reading this,
please try to appreciate him/her; it requires a lot of effort.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
